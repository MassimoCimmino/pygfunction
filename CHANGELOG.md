### Bug fixes

* [Commit 0b2d364](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/commit/0b2d3645e480be9892533dcbd9df80412ca7210f) - `boreholes.U_shaped_field()` and `boreholes.U_shaped_field()` did not construct the field properly when called with low form factors
* [Commit 62acd42](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/commit/62acd428187854c71c9e37fe2dc479bbbb9c0eb4) - Criteria for smooth pipe correlation in calculation of Darcy friction factor was too large. Colebrooke-White equation is now always used for turbulent flow.
