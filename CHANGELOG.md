# History of changes

## Current version

### New features

* [Issue 4](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/issues/4) - Unit testing and integration with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/).
* [Issue 16](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/issues/16) - Added capability to import bore field from external text files.
* [Issue 18](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/issues/18) - Added capability to visualize bore fields.
* [Issue 20](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/issues/20) - Added utilities module.
* [Issue 5](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/issues/5) - Added setup.py installation script using setuptools. *pygfunction* will now be available on [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygfunction).

### Bug fixes

* [Commit 0b2d364](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/commit/0b2d3645e480be9892533dcbd9df80412ca7210f) - `boreholes.U_shaped_field()` and `boreholes.U_shaped_field()` did not construct the field properly when called with low form factors
* [Commit 62acd42](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/commit/62acd428187854c71c9e37fe2dc479bbbb9c0eb4) - Criteria for smooth pipe correlation in calculation of Darcy friction factor was too large. Colebrooke-White equation is now always used for turbulent flow.
* [Issue 14](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/issues/14) - Evaluate g-functions at a single time value.
* [Commit 7b408e9](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/commit/7b408e9392aff96832c315ac3e436e306a9b471c) - Fix interpolation of thermal response factors in cases where the minimum timestep does not correspond to the first timestep. This also fixes errors caused by rounding errors in the interpolation.
* [Issue 22](https://github.com/MassimoCimmino/pygfunction/issues/22) - Allow 1d arrays for g-function values in the initilization of load aggregation algorithms.

## Version 0.3.0 (2017-10-17)
