Simulation of fluid temperatures in a field of series-connected boreholes and reversible flow direction
*******************************************************************************************************

This example demonstrates the use of the
:doc:`networks <../modules/networks>` module to predict the fluid temperature variations
in a bore field with series-connected boreholes and reversible flow direction.

The variable fluid mass flow rates g-functions of a bore field are first calculated
using the mixed inlet fluid temperature boundary condition [1]_. Then, the effective borehole
wall temperature variations are calculated using the load aggregation scheme of Claesson and
Javed [2]_. g-Functions used in the temporal superposition are interpolated with regards to
the fluid mass flow rate at the moment of heat extraction.
