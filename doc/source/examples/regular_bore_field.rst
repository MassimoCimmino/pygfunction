***********************************************************
Definition of a bore field using pre-defined configurations
***********************************************************

This example demonstrates the use of the :doc:`borehole <../modules/boreholes>` module
to define the positions of the boreholes within a bore field using pre-define
bore field configurations.

The following script generates rectangular, box-shaped, U-shaped and L-shaped
bore fields in a 4 x 3 configuration as well as a circular field of 8
boreholes. Each field is then plotted on a separate figure.

The script is located in:
`pygfunction/examples/regular_bore_field.py`
