Definition and visualization of a borehole
******************************************

This example demonstrates the use of the :doc:`borehole <../modules/boreholes>` module
to define the positions of pipes inside a borehole and visualize the
top view of a borehole.

The following script generates boreholes with a single U-tube, a double U-tube (in series and
parallel configurations), and a coaxial borehole. The borehole cross-sections are then plotted.

The script is located in: 
`pygfunction/examples/custom_borehole.py`
