***********************************************
Simulation of a borehole using load aggregation
***********************************************

This example demonstrates the use of the
:doc:`load agggregation <load_aggregation>` module to predict the borehole
wall temperature of a single temperature with known heat extraction rates.

The g-function of a single borehole is first calculated. Then, the borehole wall
temperature variations are calculated using the load aggregation scheme of
Claesson and Javed [1]_. The time-variation of heat extraction rates is given by
the synthetic load profile of Bernier et al. [2]_.

The following script validates the load aggregation scheme with the exact
solution obtained from convolution in the Fourier domain (see ref. [3]_).

The script is located in:
`pygfunction/examples/load_aggregation.py`
