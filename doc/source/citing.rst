------------------

Improvements to *pygfunction* from v1.0 to v2.2 were presented at the IGSHPA
Annual Conference 2022:

Cimmino, M., & Cook, J.C. (2022). pygfunction 2.2: New features and improvements
in accuracy and computational efficiency. In
*Research Conference Proceedings, IGSHPA Annual Conference 2022*
(pp. 45-52). International Ground Source Heat Pump Association.
DOI: https://doi.org/10.22488/okstate.22.000015.
