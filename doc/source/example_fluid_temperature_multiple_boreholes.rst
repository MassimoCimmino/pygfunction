Simulation of fluid temperatures in a field of multiple boreholes
*****************************************************************

This example demonstrates the use of the
:doc:`networks <networks>` module to predict the fluid temperature variations
in a bore field with known heat extraction rates.

The g-function of a bore field is first calculated using the equal inlet fluid
temperature boundary condition [1]_. Then, the borehole wall temperature
variations are calculated using the load aggregation scheme of Claesson and
Javed [2]_. The time-variation of heat extraction rates is given by the
synthetic load profile of Bernier et al. [3]_. Predicted inlet and outlet fluid
temperatures of double U-tube boreholes are calculated using the model of
Cimmino [4]_.
